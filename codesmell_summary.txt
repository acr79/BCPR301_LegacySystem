    Record class
    47-56
    59-68
    75-84
Reasons:
- These methods are used to set the integer attributes of Record class.
- These methods all exhibit the same behaviour, in order to make sure that its respective attribute can only be set to a value within the legal range. The code is duplicated.
- There are also a couple of rules about what data type can be used as a parameter for these methods, therefore the code smell can be described as primitive obsession: Complex rules involved with controlling a primitive data type.
