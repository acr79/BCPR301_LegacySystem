SESSION 2

Unit test: UT_FilerFunctionality.py

Smell name: Large Class

Location: __ORIGINAL Controller.py Controller
    Functions at LOC 197, 229, 273

Reasons:
Targeting only the functions at the LOC stated above would only be a partial
 solution to solving the large class problem. Regardless, if anything was to
 removed from Controller, it would be the filer functionality first, and so
 this was done by extracting class.

As an inheritor of cmd.Cmd, Controller was originally designed to have many
 public methods for ERP functionality; so delegation was used, and creating a
 Filer class to deal with just the filer functionality was the action that was
 taken.

Refactoring review:
- To maintain the calls to other functions such as trying to comprehend
   strings and showing small reports that were happening in the Controller's
   original filer functions was a challenge, which ultimately had to be solved
   by Controller implementing an interface (AbstractController). All for the
   sake of other Controller functionality to happen as Filer did the filer
   tasks.
- Making the traditional Controller be composed of at least one other class
   might have fully solved the large class problem, but at the least
   refactoring session 5 has reduced some protected functions.
